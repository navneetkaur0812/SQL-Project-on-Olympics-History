# SQL-Project-on-Olympics-History
This project provides insights into the data about the Olympic history of 120 years from 1896 to 2016. 

There are two datasets which have been used for analysis here. 
One contains details about the athletes, their attributes and the team to which they belong. The other dataset includes details about different events which took place in different seasons of the Olympics and the athletes who participated in them and brought in medals for their teams.

By leveraging SQL queries, the following key insights have been generated from this project:

1. The team that has won the maximum gold medals over the years.

2. For each team print total silver medals and year in which they won maximum silver medal..output 3 columns
team,total_silver_medals, year_of_max_silver

3. The player that has won maximum gold medals amongst the players who have won only gold medal (never won silver or bronze) over the years

4. In each year which player has won maximum gold medal . Write a query to print year,player name and no of golds won in that year . In case of a tie print comma separated player names.

5. The event and year in which India has won its first gold medal,first silver medal and first bronze medal, print 3 columns medal,year,sport

6. Players who won gold medal in summer and winter olympics both.

7. Players who won gold, silver and bronze medal in a single olympics. print player name along with year.
